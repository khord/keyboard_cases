Designed this top shell to replace the shroud that comes attached over the pimoroni trackball. The stock trackball shell is removed by gently squeezing the retention clips together underneath the PCB.

The additional purposes of the shell are to shroud the breakout solder pins as well as provide a level housing extending the original top face of the stock shell to be flush with M2 hex socket head cap mounting screws. The head caps of the M2 screws pictured are 3.5mm in diameter and 2mm in height.

The file is really only designed for MJF, SLA, SLS printing or similar. The thin roof of the trackball cavity and its hole edge radiusing do not play well with FDM, making it not sit flush against the trackball housing and PCB.
